The game flows nicely and is easy to understand.

Players will be using play money to wager. Each wager does not change the odds in the single player version. 
Odds do change however, at the start of each new hand of play.
Players will only see their bets durning this single player version against the house.
Player will be able to earn as much as roughly 500 coins per 24 hours, should they play all day/night long.
A player wins game money based on the going odds if they guess correctly.

If the player runs out of game money, they simply can wager again for more free addition money. 

A round of play consists of 37 hands of play. Players can wager on suits as well as the numbers. At the end of a round there is a 100 second commercial, or pause. The game resets after 100 seconds so the player can continue playing.
