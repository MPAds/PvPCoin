# PvPCoin
Single player card game written in javascript. I Need help making this a reality. Multiplayer version written in c++. 

I am a full time machinist with a love for Javascript. I wrote the single player version, and am trying to show through the
Javascript code how I would like this single player version to have the wallet and transactions directly on the game board.
This is simply TESTNET right now and even though the blockchain does appear to work, its not secure and is there because
I have only learned on my own how to display it, the way I understand it. The wallet and coins are not a true confirmation and the coins have not yet been added to any file such as a wallet.dat or an array for the wallet. The coins and transactions are however blocked correctly and are held within an array[]. If you test this please keep in mind that if you refresh your browser all previous transactions and testcoins disapear and new wagers are needed to start the chain up again!

My vision is to roll out PvPcoin as people play the game within the single player version. Each wager will produce .1 PvPCoin. Each hand of play is 45 seconds long, and  a player can wager multiple times during a hand. It's easy to earn roughly 1 coin per hand so long as a player wagers at least 10times within the hand. 

The game flows nicely and is easy to understand.
Players use play money to wager. Each wager does not change the odds in the single player version. Odds do change however, at the start of each new hand of play.
Players will only see their bets durning this single player version against the house.
Player can earn as much as roughly 500 coins per 24 hours, should they play all day/night long.
If the player runs out of money they simply can wager again for more free addition money. I would like to see this changed though to where a player buys play money using coins, if they run out of play money.
A round of play consists of 37 hands of play. Players can wager on suits as well as the numbers. At the end of a round there is a 100 second commercial, or pause. The game resets after 100 seconds so the player can continue playing.

This single player version is against the house. A player wins game money based on the going odds if they guess correctly.

The idea for the coin is to allow the players to produce as many coins as they can through game play. There will be a total of
777,000,000 PvPcoins produced through this single player version. Premine will be 7,777,777 coin. Roughly 1% premine.

There is also a built in banner advertising platform. I have it disabled for the single player version, and intend to only use
it within the multiplayer version on players profile pages, and not on the actual game board.

There is also a built in MP3 player which is also set to off right now. I would like to allow players in the future to decide
if they want music through an on off button.

I am striving for a true Proof Of Transaction by way of players acting within the single player version.
A transaction is simply a bet. In this version the player will not be allowed to send coins to another wallet, or receive
coins from another player. These coins will not be spendable in anyway within this version of play. However, once all the coins
have been produced, the idea is to allow the players to then trasfer their coins to an exchange, or to the multiplayer wallet.

During this seingle player coin roll out phase, players coins will recieve STAKES, up until the roll out of the multiplayer
game version. Details have yet been determined.

During the multiplayer version , POW will be implimented to secure the network. Details have yet been determined.

During multiplay, players will use their PvPCoins during game play. The idea is to try and win other peoples PvPCoins through
play. Players will wager on what they think might be the next card being turned over from the top of the deck. During
multiplay, each bet changes the odds, and players will see all the bets as they enter the board. There is a built in leader board as well to allow players of the multiplay to view other players win/loss percentages, and more through player profile page.

Since I am not as versed in PHP I hired a programmer and we worked side by side to complete the multiplayer version which is also included in the files. I understand however that even PHP is not secure enough and I am hoping someone, or a team of knowledgable c, c#, or c++ coders will join me to make this a very positive experience.

Thanks for your time, and I hope you enjoy what I have created so far!
