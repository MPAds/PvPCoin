# PvPCoin
This version is a single player card game written in javascript. 
I recently received a verbal commitment for the project to become a c++ version. Once completed people will then be able to download the wallet and game to their desktops. Playing the single player version will reward players with actual coins as they play.

Once all the coins are produced players will then be able to use those coins in the multiplayer version and battle head to head with other players. Once all the coins are produced, players will then be able to buy and sell through an exchange.

This single player version, shows through the Javascript code how I envision everythng working together.
This is simply TESTNET right now. The blockchain does appear to work, its not secure and is there because
I have only learned on my own how to display it, the way I understand it. 

The wallet and coins are not a true confirmation, and the coins have not yet been added to any file such as a wallet.dat, or an array for the wallet. The coins and transactions are however blocked correctly, and are held within an array[]. If you test this please keep in mind that if you refresh your browser all previous transactions, and testcoins disapear, and new wagers are needed to start the chain up again!

My vision is to roll out 777,777,777 PvPcoin with the c++ version. Each wager will produce .1 PvPCoin. Each hand of play is 45 seconds long, and a player can wager multiple times during a hand. It's easy to earn roughly 1 coin per hand so long as a player wagers at least 10 times within the hand. Premine will be 7,777,777 coin. Roughly 1% premine.

The game flows nicely and is easy to understand.

Players will be using play money to wager. Each wager does not change the odds in the single player version. 
Odds do change however, at the start of each new hand of play.
Players will only see their bets durning this single player version against the house.
Player can earn as much as roughly 500 coins per 24 hours, should they play all day/night long.
A player wins game money based on the going odds if they guess correctly.

If the player runs out of money they simply can wager again for more free addition money. 
I would like to see this changed though to where a player buys play money using coins, if they run out of play money.

A round of play consists of 37 hands of play. Players can wager on suits as well as the numbers. At the end of a round there is a 100 second commercial, or pause. The game resets after 100 seconds so the player can continue playing.

I am striving for a true Proof Of Transaction by way of players acting within the single player version.
A transaction is simply a bet. In this version the player will not be allowed to send coins to another wallet, or receive
coins from another player. These coins will not be spendable in anyway within this version of play. However, once all the coins
have been produced, the idea is to allow the players to then trasfer their coins to an exchange, or to the multiplayer wallet.

During this seingle player coin roll out phase, players coins will recieve STAKES, up until the roll out of the multiplayer
game version. The stakes earned will count towards the entire coin total. Coins will not exceed this total. Staking ends once all coins are produced.

During the multiplayer version , POW will be implimented to secure the network. Details have yet been determined.

There is also a built in banner advertising platform. I have it disabled for the single player version, and intend to only use
it within the multiplayer version on players profile pages, and not on the actual game board.

There is also a built in MP3 player which is also set to off right now. I would like to allow players in the future to decide
if they want music through an on off button.

During multiplay, players will use their PvPCoins during game play. The idea is to try and win other peoples PvPCoins through
play. Players will wager on what they think might be the next card being turned over from the top of the deck. During
multiplay, each bet changes the odds, and players will see all the bets as they enter the board. There is a built in leader board as well to allow players of the multiplay to view other players win/loss percentages, and more through player profile page.

Thanks for your time, and I hope you enjoy what I have created so far!
