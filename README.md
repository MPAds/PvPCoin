# PvPCoin
Single player card game written in javascript. Need help making this a reality. Multiplayer version written in c++. 

I am a full time machinist with a love for Javascript.

My vision is to roll out PvPcoin as people play the game. Each wager will produce .1 PvPCoin. Each hand of play is 45 seconds long.
Player can wager multiple times during a hand. It's easy to earn roughly 1 coin per hand so long as a plyer wagers at least 10
times within the hand.

Players use play money to wager. Each wager does not change the odds. Odds change as a new hard starts.
Players will only see their bets durning this single player version against the house.
Player can earn as much as roughly 500 coins per 24 hours.
If the player runs out of money they simply can wager again for more free addition money.
A round of play consists of 37 hands of play. Players can wager on suits as well as the numbers. At the end of a round there is a
100 second commercial or pause. The game resets after 100 secods so the player can continue playing.

This single player version is against the house. A player wins game money based on the going odds if they guess correctly.
The idea for the coin is to allow the players to produce as many coins as they can through game play. There will be a total of
777,000,000 PvPcoins produced through this single player version. Premine will be 7,777,777 coin. Roughly 1% premine.

A transaction is simply a bet. In this version the player will not be allowed to send coins to another wallet, or receive
coins from another player. These cons will not be spendable in anyway within this version of play. However, once all the coins
have been produced, the idea is to allow the players to then trasfer their coins to an exchange, or to the multiplayer wallet.

During this seingle player, coin roll out phase, player coins will recieve STAKES up until the roll out of the multiplayer
game version. Details have yet been determined.

During the multiplayer version , POW will be implimented to secure the network. Details have yet been determined.

During multiplay, players will use their PvPCoins during game play. The idea is to try and win other peoples PvPCoins through
play. Players will wager on what they think might be the next card being turned over from the top of the deck. During
multiplay, each bet changes the odds and players will see all the bets as they enter the board. There is a built in leader board
to allow players of the multiplay to view other players win/loss percentages and more through player profile page.
